Program is intended to learn and repeat english vocabulary.

Reason why i write this program is to practise creating a Qt window app and using Qt widget. Second reason is to create a practical tool to help learn english vocabulary.

Reasearch say that best way to learn new information is to repeating in the following interval: after 2, 5, 9 and 15 days. My program base of this research. User can add set of words intended to learn. Creating a set generate to 4 schedule entry - date of repeat, according to mentioned interval. When repeating day come, user can repeat vocabulary.

Program store vocabulary and term data in .txt file. In the future i plane to modify the program to store any data in database (Qt sql).
